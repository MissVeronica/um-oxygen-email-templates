# UM Oxygen Builder Email Templates
Extension to Ultimate Member for integration of UM email templates with Oxygen Builder or any other selectable User folder.

## Solution
Oxygen Builder is not a WP Theme therefor can't UM template structure be used and this plugin is using a fake "Theme" for saving UM email templates.

Customized email folders are saved outside the WP Themes folder and the UM template structure is created by the plugin when required by UM.

UM Settings -> Email -> "Email_Templates - Customized Email Folder Path"

1. Download zip file. 
2. Upload the zip file as a new plugin to Wordpress
3. Activate the plugin

## Updates
Version 2.0.0 New option: UM Settings -> Email -> "Email_Templates - Customized Email Folder Path"
